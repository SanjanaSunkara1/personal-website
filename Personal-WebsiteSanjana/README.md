# Personal Website

I built this website using HTML and CSS on Replit to showcase my interests and some of the projects I've worked on. Feel free to click around and take a look!

### Project Requirements
My project adheres to the following requirements:
- Includes one home HTML page that's all about me!
- Features a navigation bar that is consistently included on all website pages.
- All text, image(s), and other content on the page are contained within appropriate HTML elements.
- Includes alt text for every image used on the website.
- Applies styles to text, image, and navigation bar elements using CSS rules.
- Utilizes classes and IDs effectively to style CSS elements.

## Project Features

- **Fresh Look**  
  The website uses a soft light teal background (`#D7F9F4`) with gradients to create a clean and welcoming feel.

- **Nice Visual Details**  
  Light shadows on tags and headings help them stand out just a bit without being too bold.

- **Responsive Design**  
  The layout works well on all screen sizes â€“ from large desktop monitors to small phones.

- **Interactive Elements**  
  Icons and language tags gently scale up and change colors when you hover over them, making the site more fun and interactive.

- **Clean Layout with Grid System**  
  I used a grid layout to keep everything organized and evenly spaced. 

- **Simple Navigation**  
  A top navigation bar lets users easily switch between pages like Portfolio, Certifications, and Awards.
